# FPS Game with Probability-Based Resource Management

> ⚠️ The `.exe` is included in the compressed files.

A survival-focused first-person shooter (FPS) that integrates mathematical modeling with dynamic gameplay mechanics.

## 🎯 Project Focus
- Survival against waves of zombies
- Real-time FPS mechanics
- Strategic resource management

## 📊 Mathematical Integration
- **Rayleigh distribution** – Controls enemy spawn locations
- **Normal distribution** – Governs timing of events
- **Beta distribution** – Models ammo and health drop probabilities

## 🧪 Key Mechanics
- Probability-based enemy and resource spawns
- Time and ammo as limited resources
- Scaling difficulty based on distribution curves

## ⚙️ Technologies & Tools
- Developed using a game engine (e.g., Unity or Unreal)
- Logic and models based on mathematical probability theory

## 🧠 Learning Highlights
- Application of statistics in real-time gameplay
- Balance of chaos and control through distributions
- Modeling uncertainty for enhanced player challenge
