This project combines mathematical distributions with a zombie-themed first-person shooter (FPS) made in Unity. It features survival mechanics, including resource management like time, ammo, and enemy spawns. Distributions like Rayleigh, Normal, and Beta were used to model key gameplay elements such as enemy appearances and resource drops.
